# rsband_local_planner
The rsband_local_planner combines an **elastic band planner**, a **reeds shepp planner** and a
**fuzzy logic based path tracking controller**, to achieve reactive local planning for Car-Like
robots with Ackermann or 4-Wheel-Steering.

Here, **reeds shepp planner** helps to generate a feasible kinodynamic trajectory between two points(start and end points).
 **elastic band planner** also generate the elastical trajectory between two points which will expands whenever obstracle comes near it and constrast when obstacle for from it.
 **fuzzy logic based path tracking controller** helps to tracking the path between two points simillar to purepersuit by writting various logical factors.



#### Installation of rsband_local_planner is an tricky work
1. First create workspace folder and src folder, install the rs_band_localplanner package inside the src folder. (https://github.com/gkouros/rsband_local_planner)

2. Need to be install fuzzylite Dependencies, so inside workspace folder follow below steps
#### How to install fuzzylite
```
$ git clone git@github.com:fuzzylite/fuzzylite.git
$ cd fuzzylite/fuzzylite
$ git checkout fuzzylite-6.x
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

3. Need to be install OMPL Dependencies, so inside workspace folder below step or link
https://github.com/ompl/ompl

4. Need to be install eband_local_planner pkg, so inside workspace src folder install eband_local_planner
https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner





#### Important Dependencies
- [eband_local_planner](https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner): Elastic Band Algorithm implementation used to dynamically deform the global path
- [OMPL](https://github.com/ompl/ompl): Motion planning library, that contains a Reeds-Shepp State Space used in the Reeds-Shepp Path Planner
- [fuzzylite](https://github.com/fuzzylite/fuzzylite):  Fuzzy logic control library, used in the fuzzy path tracking controller
